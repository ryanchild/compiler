Description: This compiler compiles programs written in the language specified in the file “project.pdf”, included in this package.  It is written in C/C++.  The scanner sequentially fetches tokens one at a time while the parser performs syntax analysis, lexical analysis, code generation and lexical / syntax error reporting.

Build instructions:
Verify maketools is installed and type “make” from the project directory.  This will build an executable called “compiler”
To build on x64_64 architectures, the following additional packages must be installed:
libc6-dev-i386
lib32stdc++6
g++-multilib
